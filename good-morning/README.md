# Good Morning
Python project that uses pyttsx3 to convert text to speech. It uses the https://www.weatherapi.com API to get the latest weather information.

## How to use
**Before you begin...**
- Be sure to get an API key from https://www.weatherapi.com

**Then**
```python
morning = morning("API KEY","ZIPCODE")
```
Replace API KEY with your API key. Replace ZIPCODE with your zipcode. Do this on line 57.  

## Ideas
You can set this program to run every time your computer boots with cron jobs if you run linux/macos or schedule task on windows.
